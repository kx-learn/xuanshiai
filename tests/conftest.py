"""Top-level test configuration.

Unit tests must never call a real LLM provider and must not depend on local
``.env`` overrides.  When the local ``.env`` sets ``AI_PROVIDER=deepseek`` and
``AI_MASTER_ENABLED=true`` (for development/联调), unit tests that read the
``settings`` singleton would otherwise route through the real DeepSeek API and
see feature gates as enabled, making them slow, flaky, non-deterministic, and
dependent on a network key.  ``settings`` is an ``lru_cache`` singleton
initialised at import time, so setting env vars at fixture time is too late;
we mutate the attributes directly to the declared defaults.

Integration tests under ``tests/integration/`` have their own conftest and may
opt into a real provider / enabled features explicitly when needed.
